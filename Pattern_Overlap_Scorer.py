'''
Module: Pattern Overlap Scorer
Version: 1.0.0
Last Updated: 2025-03-27
Purpose: Score signal strength when: Multiple patterns align (e.g., bull flag + whale spoof + MACD flip), Boost confidence only if multi-layer match.
Core Objectives:
  - Explicit profitability and risk targets alignment: Ensure pattern overlap scoring maximizes profit and minimizes risk.
  - Explicit ESG compliance adherence: Ensure pattern overlap scoring does not disproportionately impact ESG-compliant assets.
  - Explicit regulatory and compliance standards adherence: Ensure all trading activities comply with exchange regulations and UAE financial regulations.
  - Explicit 10/10 quality rating definition adherence: Code must meet all quality criteria, including modularity, error handling, metrics, logging, and testing.
Summary of Enhancements:
  - Initial version.
