# Module: profit_routing_engine.py
# Version: 1.0.0
# Last Updated: 2024-07-04
# Purpose: Routes profits to various capital pools for reinvestment, withdrawals, or strategic allocation.

# Core Objectives:
# - Profitability (50–100% daily ROI target)
# - Risk reduction (50:1 profit:loss ratio)
# - ESG-safe actions only
# - Compliance with UAE financial law
# - Clean async logic and Redis safety
# - Prometheus metrics (optional)
