# Titan Disaster Recovery Plan

## Purpose
This document outlines the procedures for restoring Titan to a fully operational state in the event of a disaster, including data loss, system failure, or regional outage.

## Scope
This plan covers the following components:
- Redis data
- Module restoration
- Configuration re-sync
- Log resumption

## Procedures

### 1. Redis Backup and Restore

#### 1.1 Backup Strategy
- **Regular Backups:** Implement regular Redis backups using RDB snapshots. Backups should be performed daily at a minimum, with hourly backups recommended for critical data.
- **Backup Location:** Store backups in a geographically diverse location, such as a separate cloud region or on-premise storage.
- **Backup Retention:** Retain backups for at least 30 days to allow for recovery from various failure scenarios.

#### 1.2 Redis Restore Procedure
1. **Identify Latest Backup:** Locate the latest valid RDB snapshot from the backup location.
2. **Stop Redis Instance:** Shut down the affected Redis instance to prevent data corruption during the restore process.
3. **Replace Data Directory:** Replace the contents of the Redis data directory with the RDB snapshot.
4. **Start Redis Instance:** Start the Redis instance. Redis will automatically load the data from the RDB snapshot.
5. **Verify Data Integrity:** Verify that the data has been restored correctly by checking key counts, data values, and system functionality.

### 2. Module Restoration

#### 2.1 Module Deployment
- **Dockerized Modules:** Ensure all Titan modules are containerized using Docker for easy deployment and management.
- **Orchestration:** Use Docker Compose or Kubernetes to orchestrate the deployment of modules across multiple hosts.
- **Image Repository:** Store Docker images in a private image repository to ensure availability and security.

#### 2.2 Module Restoration Procedure
1. **Identify Failed Modules:** Determine which modules have failed or are experiencing issues.
2. **Stop Failed Modules:** Stop the affected modules to prevent further errors.
3. **Redeploy Modules:** Redeploy the modules using Docker Compose or Kubernetes. This will automatically pull the latest Docker images and start the modules.
4. **Verify Functionality:** Verify that the modules are functioning correctly by checking logs, monitoring metrics, and testing key functionality.

### 3. Configuration Re-sync

#### 3.1 Configuration Management
- **Centralized Configuration:** Store all Titan configuration in a centralized location, such as a Git repository or a configuration management system.
- **Version Control:** Use version control to track changes to the configuration and allow for easy rollback to previous versions.

#### 3.2 Configuration Re-sync Procedure
1. **Identify Configuration Source:** Determine the source of the latest valid configuration.
2. **Apply Configuration:** Apply the configuration to the Titan system. This may involve updating Redis keys, restarting modules, or running configuration scripts.
3. **Verify Configuration:** Verify that the configuration has been applied correctly by checking system settings, monitoring metrics, and testing key functionality.

### 4. Log Resumption

#### 4.1 Logging Strategy
- **Centralized Logging:** Implement centralized logging using a tool such as Elasticsearch, Graylog, or Splunk.
- **Log Retention:** Retain logs for at least 30 days to allow for analysis of past events.

#### 4.2 Log Resumption Procedure
1. **Identify Log Source:** Determine the source of the latest logs.
2. **Resume Logging:** Configure Titan to resume logging to the centralized logging system.
3. **Verify Log Integrity:** Verify that logs are being collected correctly and that no data has been lost.

### 5. Post-Recovery Steps

1. **Monitor System Performance:** Monitor system performance closely after recovery to identify any remaining issues.
2. **Document Recovery Process:** Document the entire recovery process, including any issues encountered and steps taken to resolve them.
3. **Review and Update Plan:** Review and update this disaster recovery plan regularly to ensure that it remains effective and up-to-date.
